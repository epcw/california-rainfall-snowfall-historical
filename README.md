# California Rainfall & Snowfall Historical data scraper

## Description
Python & Selenium based Webscraper to pull historical precipitation data for individual monitoring stations since 1930 from the California Department of Water Resources.

## Getting started:
* This is written in Python3, not 2, and comes with wrapper shells to properly set up the python packages.  Run the .sh files, NOT the .py ones, using Bash or another shell script.  Windows users, you can do this through a Bash for Windows utility (I recommend [Cygwin](https://www.cygwin.com/); it is free and open source)
* You'll need to install a couple of packages, most notably selenium and geckodriver (to run Firefox automatically)
* This assumes a Unix/Linux based filesystem.  For Windows, change the download and file directories accordingly (specifically, replace the "~" home directory with wherever you are working in Windows).

## Acknowledgement
* This software can be used for any non-commercial purpose as long as Patrick W. Zimmerman of [Principally Uncertain](https://principallyuncertain.com) is given credit for its creation.
